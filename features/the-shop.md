# The Shop

The shop is a way of buying and selling items to/from the server. It can be used to earn money or to save grinding.

The shop is fairly straightforward, and can be accessed with `/shop`. This opens a GUI where you can navigate to the different categories, which buy and sell different items.&#x20;



Shops have a limited stock of items, and the prices change to reflect this. If the stock is low, prices will be high, whereas high stocks means low prices. Stock prices slowly stablilize over time.
