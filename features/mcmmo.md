# mcMMO

mcMMO is a plugin that adds a skill system to Minecraft. This means that as you do common tasks like mining, planting crops, and combat, you'll gain new abilitites to make these tasks more interesting



mcMMO is a **huge** plugin, so we can't document all of its features, but here are a few common commands. For a much more detailed guide, check the [mcMMO Wiki](https://mcmmo.fandom.com/wiki/McMMO\_Wiki)



### Skill Information

To show information about a certain skill, use `/<skillname>`. For example, to show information about the mining skill, you'd type `/mining`.&#x20;

This will show your level and which abilities you've unlocked. To see more information, use `/<skillname> ? [page]`&#x20;



### All Skill Levels

To see all your skill levels, use `/mcstats`

To see someone else's skill levels, use `/mcinspect <player>`

### Rankings

To see the mcMMO skill leaderboard, use `/mctop` or `/mctop <skill>` (e.g `/mctop woodcutting` shows the players with the best woodcutting skills)

To see your position on the leaderboards, use `/mcrank`

To see someone else's position, use `/mcrank <player>`
