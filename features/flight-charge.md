# Flight Charge

You can buy temporary flight with the command `/recharge`

This opens a GUI which lets you purchase flight with XP or money



Flight charge is measured in blocks, so flying for 1 block will use 1 block of your flight charge.

Hovering in the air without moving will drain 1-3 blocks of charge every few seconds.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you run out of charge, you'll be teleported to the ground below you. You won't take fall damage!
{% endhint %}
